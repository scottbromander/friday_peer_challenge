# Friday Peer Challenge

Your task, for you and your peer, is to get the name of each person in the provided array, to appear on the Dom.
But to ONLY show the name of the person relative to the indexTracker variable. So when the page loads, "Dana" should 
appear. Clicking on the next button, should then display "Pui". If on Dana, clicking the Prev Button should then show 
"Sam".

Feel free to explore how our carousel works by including more names and trying different things out!

Good Luck!
